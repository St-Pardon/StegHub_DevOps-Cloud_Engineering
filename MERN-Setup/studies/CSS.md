## CSS: Bringing Style to Your Web Pages

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style and present web pages. It's the magic behind the visual elements you see â€“ the fonts, colors, layouts, and more.  Without CSS, web pages would be plain text documents.

**What Does CSS Do?**

CSS separates the presentation (style) of a web page from its content (structure). This separation offers several benefits:

* **Maintainability:**  CSS keeps your HTML code clean and focused on content, making it easier to maintain and update.
* **Reusability:**  Styles defined in CSS can be applied to multiple HTML elements, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.
* **Responsiveness:**  CSS allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 

**Basic CSS Syntax:**

CSS code is written in a series of rules. Each rule consists of three main parts:

1. **Selector:**  This specifies the HTML element(s) the style will be applied to. Selectors can target elements by ID, class name, tag name, or a combination of these.
2. **Declaration:**  This defines a specific style property and its value.  For example, `color: red;` sets the text color to red.
3. **Block:**  Declarations are enclosed within curly braces `{}` to group them into a single rule.

Here's an example of a basic CSS rule:

```css
h1 {  /* Selector: target all h1 elements */
  color: blue;  /* Declaration: set text color to blue */
  font-size: 2em;  /* Declaration: set font size to 2 times the default */
}
```

**Common CSS Properties:**

* `color`: Sets the text color of an element.
* `font-family`: Specifies the font used for text.
* `font-size`: Defines the size of the text.
* `background-color`: Sets the background color of an element.
* `margin`: Controls the spacing around an element.
* `padding`: Defines the space between the element's border and its content.
